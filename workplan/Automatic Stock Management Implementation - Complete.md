## üîÑ Process Flows

### Stock Reservation Flow
1. **Cart Validation**: Check stock before adding items
2. **Checkout Begins**: Reserve stock for 15 minutes
3. **Payment Processing**: Stock remains reserved
4. **Payment Success**: Convert reservations to permanent reduction
5. **Payment Failure**: Release reservations back to available stock
6. **Timeout**: Automatic cleanup releases expired reservations

### Order Status Flow
1. **Order Created**: Status = pending, no stock changes
2. **Admin Confirms**: Status = confirmed ‚Üí **Stock automatically reduced**
3. **Order Cancelled**: Status = cancelled ‚Üí **Stock automatically restored**
4. **Order Delivered**: Update sales analytics and metrics

### Error Handling Flow
1. **Stock Validation Fails**: Show user-friendly error message
2. **Reservation Fails**: Prevent checkout, show stock unavailable
3. **Stock Reduction Fails**: Create admin alert for manual intervention
4. **System Errors**: Log errors, create system alerts

- **Admin Notifications**: Email/system alerts for critical issues

### Audit Trail
- All stock movements recorded with timestamps
- Order IDs linked to inventory changes
- User actions tracked for accountability
- Reasons provided for all stock adjustments

### Performance Monitoring
