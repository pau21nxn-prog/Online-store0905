## 📋 MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED

### 🖼️ Logo Upload to Firebase Storage

**CRITICAL**: The email template is configured to use the ADF logo, but it must be manually uploaded to Firebase Storage.

#### Upload Instructions:
1. **Go to Firebase Console**: [Firebase Storage Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/annedfinds/storage)
2. **Create Folder**: Create a folder named `email-assets`
3. **Upload Logo**: 
   - Upload the file: `C:\Users\pau\anned_finds\images\Logo\Logo.png`
   - Rename it to: `logo.png`
   - Full path should be: `email-assets/logo.png`
4. **Set Permissions**: Make the file publicly readable (click on file → make public)

#### Expected URL:
```
https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/annedfinds.appspot.com/o/email-assets%2Flogo.png?alt=media
```

**Note**: The email template is already configured to use this URL. Once uploaded, logos will appear in all new order confirmation emails.
